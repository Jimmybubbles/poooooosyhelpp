# create a scanner that incorporates the fader and the channels into one scanning tool

"""
basically the price point is the main focus because I have limited resources as far as betting on the scan.
so do a hirachy of importance

1 the indicators, they have to have had a red green shift in the fader indicators that are currently printing a channel and the candle is on the lower channel line.
2 the current hardest challenge is understanding the code to get this need solved the JMA is done as far as a python change.
3 back to point. the current process is download the price ohlc vol and ticker name from yfinance
4 once that data is downloaded into individual csv files we then want to update those files with a new data frame order.
5 i am still trying to understand this change as i dont have a good background with csv files and conversions as to why you woould have the spaces empty with a api
6 but i think imight have answered my own question cause the api will dowanload things without saving them which would account for the spaces being null
