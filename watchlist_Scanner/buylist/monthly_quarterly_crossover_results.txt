================================================================================

LEGEND:
  M-Low/M-Close: Previous Month Low/Close
  Q-Low/Q-Open: Previous Quarter Low/Open
  Breakdown%: How far below quarter level (negative = worse)
  Recovery%: Current price vs quarter low (positive = recovering)

TRADING IMPLICATIONS:
  [CRITICAL] CONFIRMED BREAKDOWN: Avoid or consider shorting
     - Month closed below quarter low = strong bearish signal
     - Wait for reclaim of quarter low before considering long

  [WARNING] SEVERE WEAKNESS: Caution, watch for further breakdown
     - Month violated quarter low but closed above it
     - Vulnerable, but not confirmed breakdown yet

  [CAUTION] MODERATE WEAKNESS: Early warning signal
     - Trading below quarter open but above quarter low
     - Monitor for potential recovery or further weakness

CONTRARIAN OPPORTUNITY:
  Stocks with large negative Breakdown% but positive Recovery%
  may be bouncing from oversold levels - potential reversals
